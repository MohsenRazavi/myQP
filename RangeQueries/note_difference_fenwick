for very huge size of array with very huge values
in a situation which we want to apply lots of updates
it is a good idea to convert our array to difference array
and then make a fenwick tree of that difference array
because updating fenwick tree is order of O(logn)
and fenwick tree it self saves prefix sum of values so
we can access elements of array in order O(logn) (sum of 0th index to kth)
